MakeMKV Automatic Beta key Update Tool

## Reasoning

The beta key expires quite often.
This requires an annoying extra step to obtain the new MakeMKV beta Key.

## How it Works

This tool contacts the API of https://cable.ayra.ch/makemkv/ to get the latest key. It uses the "raw" API method.

## Installing

The application will check various locations for the installed version of MakeMKV, this includes the default installation directory.

### For the Installed Version (regular)

If you installed MakeMKV using the provided installer and didn't change the installation path,
you can launch the key updater from any location directly.

### For the Installed Version (custom)

If you installed into a custom directory, place the updater into the same directory and create a shortcut to the updater on the Desktop.
Of course, creating the shortcut is optional.
**The updater needs to be launched manually, if you just launch MakeMKV itself, the key will not update**

### Portable Version

If you run MakeMKV as portable version, follow the cursom procedure above.
**The updater needs to be launched manually, if you just launch MakeMKV itself, the key will not update**
