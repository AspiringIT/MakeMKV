**Describe the bug**

*Insert short but descriptive text here*

**Environment**

- [ ] I am able to access https://cable.ayra.ch/makemkv/
- [ ] The beta key on that page is written in a **green** box
- [ ] The key is identical to the one published in the official forum

If the first step failed, check if all of cable.ayra.ch is down. If it is, cancel this issue and just wait a little.

If the box in the second step is not green, you are either color blind or (more likely) the key has expired but the author did not yet update it. Cancel this issue and reload after the timer runs out.

If the key is not identical or completely missing, something on the page is messed up. Continue with this issue.
