# Contributions to this repository

This product revolves around a single API call.

Any "proper" guideline document would be longer than the source code to execute the API command and store the value in the registry.

So here's a short form:

## Providing code as "Pull Request"

- Don't be a dick and maybe I accept your pull request

## Error reports as "Issues"

- Don't be a dick and maybe I fix your issue

## Requesting new feature as "Issues"

- Don't be a dick and maybe I implement your idea
